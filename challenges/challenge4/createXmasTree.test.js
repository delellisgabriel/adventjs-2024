// It's time to put up the Christmas tree at home! ðŸŽ„ But this year we want it to be special. We're going to create a function that receives the height of the tree (a positive integer between 1 and 100) and a special character to decorate it.

// The function should return a string that represents the Christmas tree, constructed as follows:

// The tree is made up of triangles of special characters.
// The spaces on the sides of the tree are represented with underscores _.
// All trees have a trunk of two lines, represented by the # character.
// The tree should always have the same length on each side.
// You must ensure the tree has the correct shape using line breaks \n for each line.
