// Santa Claus ðŸŽ… is checking his workshop inventory to prepare gift delivery. The elves have recorded the toys in an array of objects, but the information is a bit disorganized. You need to help Santa organize the inventory.

// You will receive an array of objects, where each object represents a toy and has the properties:

// name: the name of the toy (string).
// quantity: the available quantity of that toy (integer).
// category: the category to which the toy belongs (string).
// Write a function that processes this array and returns an object that organizes the toys as follows:

// The keys of the object will be the categories of toys.
// The values will be objects that have the toy names as keys and the total quantities of each toy in that category as values.
// If there are toys with the same name in the same category, you must sum their quantities.
// If the array is empty, the function should return an empty object {}.
